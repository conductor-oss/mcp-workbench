# MCP Workbench

A powerful, visual tool for debugging and testing [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers. Built with React + TypeScript + Vite, it provides a premium developer experience for inspecting resources, executing tools, and monitoring protocol traffic in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- **Streamable HTTP Support**: Strictly adheres to the "Streamable HTTP" transport specification (POST-only, stateless).
- **Protocol Inspector**: Real-time log viewer for all JSON-RPC messages, including `initialize` handshake and capability discovery.
- **Tools Tester**: Execute tools with dynamically generated forms based on their JSON Schema.
- **Resource Explorer**: Inspect and browse server-side resources.
- **Prompt Tester**: View and test available prompts.
- **Advanced Authentication**:
    - **OAuth 2.0**: Full Authorization Code flow with popup-based authentication.
    - **API Keys**: Custom header support for secure connections.
- **Multi-Server Management**: Save and manage multiple server configurations.
- **Solarized Light Theme**: A clean, premium aesthetic designed for long debugging sessions.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/conductoross/mcp-workbench.git
   cd mcp-workbench
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📡 Transport & Connectivity

This workbench is designed specifically for **Streamable HTTP**. 

- **Method**: Every message is sent via `HTTP POST`.
- **Stateless**: The client manages the `MCP-Session-Id` header (captured from the server's initialization response).
- **CORS**: Ensure your MCP server is configured to allow requests from the workbench origin.

### Local Debugging with ngrok

If you are testing a local MCP server, we recommend using `ngrok` to expose it:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

The workbench automatically handles bypass headers for ngrok (`ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true`).

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **React + TypeScript**: Functional components with robust type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern styling using a curated Solarized color palette.
- **Zod**: Runtime validation for protocol messages and capability schemas.
- **Context API**: Centralized state management for connections and protocol logs.
- **Custom Transport**: A custom `DirectClientTransport` implementation that bypasses standard SSE for efficient POST-only communication.
